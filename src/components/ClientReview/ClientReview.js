                        <p>This course was short but very informative and very helpful for an aspiring leader like myself. It also helped me understand how to view or understand when I receive feedback. I highly recommend it!.</p>

                        <p>I enjoyed the course and learned a lot from it. The content is well organised and focused on practical situations. I particularly enjoyed the bits of psychological research shared in the content.

                        <p>This course is difficult for me to rate until I've had at least a month of practice so I can see if it has truly been useful or not.  I did enjoy the course, however, and found it to be helpful in theory. </p>
